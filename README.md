## Intro
This repo is for housing assorted Zeek scripts that may be useful for others.  I'll continue to add things here as I dust them off and test them against Zeek 3.x.  I'll also try to keep this TOC up to date. More info can be found in the script's comments. 

| Script Name              | Description                                                   |
